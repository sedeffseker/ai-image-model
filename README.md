# Image AI Model Project

## Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from Roboflow. The images were initially unlabeled and manually annotated.

## Labeling
All images were labeled using Roboflow annotation tools.

## Preprocessing
Images were resized and normalized before training.

## Augmentation
Data augmentation was not applied in this stage.

## Model Selection
A convolutional neural network (CNN) based model was selected after reviewing relevant literature.

## Training Results
Model accuracy and loss were recorded during training. Training graphs are saved in the models folder.
